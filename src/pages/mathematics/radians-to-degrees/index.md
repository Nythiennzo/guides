## Radians to Degrees

The measurement in Redian is directly proportional to that in Degrees meaning that:


1 Radian = K Degrees where K is a constant.

For this relation the constant K is 180/π where π (PI) ≈ 3.14159 thus 1 Radian = 180/π Degrees


### Examples:

2 Radian = 2 * 180/π Degrees

2.5 Radian = 2.5 * 180/π Degrees

0.3 Radian = 0.3 * 180/π Degrees
