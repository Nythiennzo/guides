## Fractions

A fraction represents part of a whole number, a value between 0 and 1.

A fraction normally has two parts:

* Numerator: Represents the number of equal parts marking up the fraction.

* Denominator: Represents the number by which the numerator is divided to make the fraction.

The numerator and denominator are both integers (whole numbers).

A proper fraction is one where the numerator is less than the denominator.

Fractions can also be added after a whole number to increase its accuracy.

### Examples

1½ represents 1 + 1/2 or 1.5.

Not all fractions have decimal representations:

⅓ or 1/3 represents 1 divided by 3
